# yt channel yoink

Has a user login via OAuth and lists out all the channels they're subbed to with their ids. Sidenote this is a tweaked version of an example that's on google's api docs.

## Why this exists

I'm working on getting off of youtube and part of that effort is making a list of channels that I find enjoyable so that I can grab all their rss link thingies and only watch youtube videos from the rss feeds, slowly widdling those down until I'm not watching youtube anymore.

## When I click the link and log in it sends me to a page that doesn't exist and I can't get the code

The code is in the url and I can't be bothered setting something up to display it in the web page though if I come back to this to clean it up a bit I may add that.
